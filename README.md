Random graph creation utilities

The source code compiles into several executables for creating random graphs.

randomgraph creates a random Erdos-Renyii graph, where each edge had equal parobability.

random_WS_graph creates a random Watts-Srogatz graph.

random_BA_graph creates a random Barabasi-Albert graph.

randombipartitegraph creates a random bipartite graph, where each edge has equal probability.

randomkpartite graph creates a random k-partite graph, with equal probability edges.
